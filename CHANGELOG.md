# Barapost changelog

## 2025-10-05 edition.

### barapost-prober, barapost-local

A patch update.

Fixed a bug that would cause barapost-prober and barapost-local to crash while requesting taxonomy from NCBI Taxonomy.

## Vesrion changes:

- barapost-prober: `1.24.b --> 1.24.c`
- barapost-local: `3.18.f --> 3.18.g`

## 2025-02-05 edition.

### barapost-prober

A patch update.

Now, barapost-prober won't crush if it cannot parse a taxonomy ID from a GenBank page. It will arrogantly ignore such a record and give it empty taxonomy.

## Vesrion changes:

- barapost-prober: `1.24.a --> 1.24.b`

## 2023-05-26 edition.

### barapost-binning

- Now the script won't just terminate if it does not find some reads in the index. The script will just omit the reads.

### barapost-local

- Fix a bug in search for related replicons. The thing is, since Python 3.9 the `xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.getchildren` method is removed, and barapost-local used it. Now it does not, and the bug is gone.

- A note. Previously, Barapost was tested on `h5py` package version 2.10.0. However, its dependency, `numpy`, does not have attribute `typeDict` since version 1.21.0, and `h5py` 2.10.0 used this attribute. This used to cause Barapost failure (error message `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'typeDict'`). Now, Barapost is tested on `h5py` 3.8.0, and the inconsistency is gone.

## Vesrion changes:

- barapost-local: `3.18.e --> 3.18.f`
- barapost-binning: `4.9.b --> 4.9.c`

## 2022-08-02 edition.

- barapost-binning: fix a bug that didn't allow to recover taxonomy.

## Vesrion changes:

- barapost-binning: `4.9.a --> 4.9.b`

## 2021-11-19 edition.

- barapost-binning: this script now does not terminate with error if it cannot find the classification for an input sequence. Instead, it now places all these sequences into a `classification_not_found` file. This file is different from the `unknown` file: an `unknowm` file contains sequences, for which similarity was not found during the classification. And a `classification_not_found` contains sequences, which have not been classified at all.

## Vesrion changes:

- barapost-binning: `4.8.d --> 4.9.a`

## 2021-06-24 edition.

- barapost-prober: removed option `-e`, since it is the **program author's** email that [should](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/) be sent to BLAST server within requests, not user's one.

## Vesrion changes:

- barapost-prober: `1.23.b --> 1.24.a`

## 2019-12-26 edition.

- barapost-prober, barapost-local: lineage downloading optimized;

### Version changes:

1. barapost-prober: `1.14.a --> 1.14.b`;
2. barapost-local: `3.7.a --> 3.7.b`;


## 2019-12-22 edition. Classification algorithm modified

- Full lineages are now used for classification instead of just hit definitions;
- If several best hits have equal Bit scores, lowest common ancestor (LCA) of these hits will be determined and used for classification;

### Version changes:

1. barapost-prober: `1.13.c --> 1.14.a`;
2. barapost-local: `3.6.d --> 3.7.a`;
3. barapost-binning: `4.0.a --> 4.1.a`;

## 2019-12-19 edition

### Noteworthy changes:

1. barapost-prober: '-x' sequence pruning fixed;
2. barapost-prober: resuming bug fixed;

### Version changes:

1. barapost-prober: `1.13.b --> 1.13.c`;

## 2019-12-12 edition

### Noteworthy changes:

1. barapost-prober: seq IDs formatting fixed;

### Version changes:

1. barapost-prober: `1.13.a --> 1.13.b`;

## 2019-12-10 evening edition (barapost-prober's '-x' option added)

### Noteworthy changes:

1. barapost-prober: '-x' ('--max-seq-len') option enabled. It is now possible to prune sequences that barapost-prober sends to NCBI in order to spare NCBI BLAST servers;

### Version changes:

1. barapost-prober: `1.12.m --> 1.13.a`;

## 2019-12-10 edition (bug fix)

### Noteworthy changes:

1. barapost-prober, barapost-local: error while processing .fasta and .fasta.gz files fixed;

### Version changes:

1. barapost-prober: `1.12.k --> 1.12.m`;
2. barapost-local: `3.6.c --> 3.6.d`;

## 2019-12-07 edition (parallel binning enabled)
